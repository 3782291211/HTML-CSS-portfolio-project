## Proficiency overview

Here are some of the skills I've demonstrated by completing this project:
- Heavy emphasis on **responsive web design** through extensive use of finely-tuned media queries, relative units and dynamic structures.
- **Interactive CSS** design, through the use of animations, pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes.
- **DOM manipulation** using JavaScript to provide user interactivity.
- Use of developer tools.
   - Responsiveness was tested rigorously on a wide range of specific smartphone and tablet models with varying display dimesions.
   - Performance was tested using rendering tools and analytics, including simulations of severe hardware/network limitations.
