        Born under traumatic circumstances, Scorpius endured a very difficult childhood under Scarran guardianship. At birth, he was taken by the Scarrans and never knew his birth parents. Whilst in captivity, he was severely mistreated and treated as a tool to serve the Scarrans. He relented for decades and was eventually able to escape his captors, soon joining the Peacekeepers and swiftly climbing the ranks through loyal service and competence.

        John always aspired to be an astronaut and follow in the footsteps of his dad. But he never dreamed of seeing the stars, much less being the very first human to make contact with not one, not two, and not three, but many different alien species. John's journey after leaving Earth was a very difficult one, full of pain and tragedy, yet despite everything, he eventually found a measure of peace in himself and in those around him.

        <article id="rygel" class="hovertext" data-hover="Before his captivity, Domiar Rygel was sovereign to over 600 billion loyal subjects on his home planet, in the Hyneria cluster. His cousin orchestrated a coup which led to Rygel's capture by the Peacekeepers. Having been a member of the royal class all of his life, he had to learn to adjust to life as a prisoner. Eventually, he would acquire the means to break free of his captivity but only ending up having to constantly evade capture yet again. He is known for his voracious appetite and three stomachs that never seem to get full. Even in the heat of battle, food is always his main priority.">

        <article id="zhaan" class="hovertext" data-hover="
        Zhaan is a Delvian who has spent the last few years in Peacekeeper captivity. It was during this time that she managed to reconnect with her spiritual roots and to rise above her worldly worries. Zhaan prefers a peaceful solution to most problems but is pragmatic enough to recognise the need for an alternative approach in some situations. She is always on hand to provide guidance and counsel to those in need.

            <h3>Zhaan</h3>
            <p>Despite striving for inner peace, Zhaan's life has been marked by violence and trauma, yet she never wavers from her spiritual path, even during her imprisonment.</p>

        <article id="crais" class="hovertext" data-hover="Before crossing paths with Crichton, Captain Bialar Crais held a position of respect and power within the Peacekeeper hierarchy, into which he was conscripted as a child.

            <h3>Crais</h3>
            <p>Tactical, unforgiving and highly disciplined is Crais. Born and raised as a peacekeeper, he grew to respect the force of authority and embraced his servitude.</p>

        <article id="dargo" class="hovertext" data-hover="Dargo is a Luxan warrior, famoulsy known for his Luxan hyper-rage which causes him to come across as angry and aggressive.

Dargo is Crichton's closest friend on the show and the two shared a very strong bond of camaraderie.">

            <p>Like Crais, Aeryn was also born into military service and knows no other way. But after being betrayed for carrying out her duty, she id forced to re-examine her worldview.</p>
